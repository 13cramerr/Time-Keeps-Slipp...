Before using please run:
    "$ sudo dpkg --configure -a"
and then run: 
    "$ sudo apt isntall gnustep-gui-runtime"
this will allow your computer to talk to you! (:

Hello! To use the timer:
* pull up a seperate terminal and cd into the "/Time Keeps Slipp.../lib" folder
* run "ruby main.rb"
* select which timer you would like to use and follow directions from there

P.S. I don't know if this works on macOS and to start a new timer, the only thing
    you can do as of right now is to ctrl-C and rerun the app. This was mainly a project that I came up with to play around with the text-to-speech stuff 


Have fun and play around with the code and the messages! (:
